Frontera Hackathon Event: Sustainability

This is a website dedicated to crop rotation/crop cycling

In this project, we wanted to create a website that could help farmers select their next crop that grows well in their region, based on their currently growing crop.
The purpose of crop rotation is to circulate between "Leaves, Fruits, Roots, and Legumes." This encourages good soil health that the crop can benefit from.

Leaves are plants that benefit from high nitrogen in the soil, fruits benefit from high phosphorus, roots benefit from high potassium, and legumes return nitrogen to the soil.

To get this project to work, please:
